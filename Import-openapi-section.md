### Import Statements:

```python
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
```
1. openai: This module is used to interact with the OpenAI API. It provides functions for making requests to the OpenAI API endpoints.
1. os: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as reading environment variables.
1. dotenv: This module is used to load environment variables from a .env file.
   
### Load Environment Variables:

```python
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
```

1. load_dotenv(find_dotenv()): This line loads environment variables from a .env file located in the current directory or its parent directories. The find_dotenv() function searches for the .env file in the directory hierarchy and returns the path to the first .env file found.
1. _: The underscore _ is used as a variable name to store the return value of load_dotenv(). The variable name is often used when the actual value is not needed and only the function execution is desired.
   
### Set OpenAI API Key:

```python

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

1. os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'): This line retrieves the value of an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY. The API key is expected to be stored securely in the .env file.
1. openai.api_key: This sets the retrieved API key as the authentication key to be used when making requests to the OpenAI API. This key authenticates the script and grants access to the OpenAI services.
   
> In summary, this code sets up the OpenAI API integration by loading the API key from a .env file and then configuring the openai module to use this key for authentication when interacting with the OpenAI services. This separation of the API key from the code helps maintain security and prevents exposing sensitive credentials in the source code.
